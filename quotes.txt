"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"
"You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough"
"Be the change that you wish to see in the world"
"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift of God, which is why we call it the present"
"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live"
"If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything"
"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"
